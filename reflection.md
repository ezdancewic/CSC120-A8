Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class is a the protagonist of an interactive adventure inspired by Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. You first create your protagonist by giving them a name and a height, and then they fall down a rabbit hole and interact with the various potions that they find there. I included actual description and dialogue from the Alice and Wonderland text, and named my potions after the real effects of the EAT ME and DRINK ME items. However, I had to come up with a third potion that allowed the protagonist to fly, and therefore I added SMELL ME. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
In addition to the required methods, I also added fall(), which prints a string describing the setting of the rabbithole, printStats() which lets the player check the protagonist's height and abilities, and printInventory() which lets the player check whats in the protagonist's inventory. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
A lot of things worked with this homework, I was really excited with the idea I chose to go with and I felt it came together fairly easily. The most challenging aspect was implementing the items as strings, rather than coming up with a new "potion" class. I would advise someone taking this course in the future to choose a topic that lends itself well to the interface that we have to work with.
